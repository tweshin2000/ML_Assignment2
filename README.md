# Machine Learning Assignment 2

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to implement multiple classification models
on a chosen dataset and evaluate their performance using standard metrics.

## Dataset Description
The Heart Disease dataset is used for this project. The dataset contains
clinical parameters used to predict the presence of heart disease.

- Instances: ~1000
- Features: 13
- Target Variable: target (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)

## Models Used

| ML Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|----------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|----|-----|
| Logistic Regression | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Decision Tree | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| kNN | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Naive Bayes | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Random Forest | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| XGBoost | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Observations
- Logistic Regression performs well for linear decision boundaries
- Decision Tree captures non-linear patterns
- kNN sensitive to feature scaling
- Naive Bayes assumes independence
- Random Forest improves stability
- XGBoost typically provides best performance
